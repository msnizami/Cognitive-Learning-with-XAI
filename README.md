## Toward Enhanced Cognitive Learning with Explainable AI (CL-XAI)

Welcome to the GitHub repository for CL-XAI, an interactive game designed to enhance cognitive learning through domain-agnostic combinatorial tasks. The game is deployed on our web server, and you can access it [here](http://85.235.144.146:8888/index.html).

### Overview

As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly prevalent in making critical decisions, there is a growing demand for Explainable AI (XAI). CL-XAI addresses this demand by providing insights into the internal mechanisms of AI models, fostering cognitive learning and understanding of complex concepts.

### Key Objectives

Our research focuses on two main objectives:

1. **Understanding Human Comprehension:** Explore how human learners comprehend AI models using XAI tools.
2. **Evaluating Tool Effectiveness:** Evaluate the effectiveness of XAI tools through valuable human feedback.

### CL-XAI in Action

CL-XAI is demonstrated through a game-inspired virtual use case. In this scenario, learners engage in combinatorial problem-solving tasks. The goal is to enhance problem-solving skills and deepen understanding of complex concepts. This innovative approach showcases the transformative potential of CL-XAI in the field of cognitive learning and co-learning.
